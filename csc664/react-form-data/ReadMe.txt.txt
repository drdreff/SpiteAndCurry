Welcome to the CSC 664 project of Matthew Davis.

This project requires Python 3.6 or greater.

In order to run, compile, and open the project, simply run the openProject.bat file (this simply runs the two individual openDRF.bat and openReact.bat files). This will open the react app your favored browser.

Using the app is fairly straight forwards. Adding images and new facets is done from the left side using the labeled buttons.
To add a region, simply draw a region and click the check. This will open a modal allowing you to link the image to more images.
To submit a search, click upon a region and click "search". This will create a graph in the view pane displaying images and their links. Clicking on an image will change the left window to change to that image.
